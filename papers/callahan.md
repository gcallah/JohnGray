# A Touch of Gray

*Every silver lining's got a touch of gray* -- Robert Hunter

## Introduction

It is a great privilege to have the opportunity to comment upon the work of John Gray. His output has been so extensive
and his thought has seen so much development that one could easily write a book tracing his intellectual odyssey, and so
a mere paper on the topic must, of necessity, be no more than a sketch. (I have previously reviewed three of Gray's
books, and some of the material below is drawn from those reviews, which one can find in the bibliography.)


He began his intellectual life on the left but moved towards libertarianism in the late 1970s, influenced by his study
of the work of Nobel Prize-winning free-market economist F.A. Hayek (Gray 1982).

Gray's libertarianism was tempered, however, by studying the work of Isaiah Berlin and Michael Oakeshott.
(Gray wrote of the latter that "Michael Oakeshott [is] clearly one of the most original and
profound British political philosophers since Hume and certainly this century's greatest conservative writer" [1996: p.
40].)


## Leaving Liberalism

### Liberalisms

A key document of this shift was his 1988 work, *Liberalisms*. It is a collection of essays written over a period of a dozen
years. As Gray describes the essays, "They embody a single project, pursued continuously over the period in which they
were written -- the project of defining liberalism and giving it a foundation." But, for liberalism, the conclusion was not a
happy one: "The enterprise ended in failure" (Gray 1988, p. vii).

"the move away from a political philosophy with the universalist pretensions as a desirable, or at any rate an inevitable move" 168

But this is a move away from political philosophy, not a positive or a different kind of political philosophy. See Bosanquet and Oakeshott.

Gray notes that, prior to the breakdown of the Western consensus the most salient event of which was the Reformation,
"the liberal problem of establishing fair principles of social cooperation among persons having incompatible and
incommensurable conceptions of the good — does not exist" (1988, p. 169).


Gray argues against Rawl's contention that justice is silent about the choice of economic system.
Gray's analysis of the unstable and inefficient nature of market socialism displays a deep understanding of the
calculation argument forwarded by Mises and Hayek, far surpassing that of today's average economist.


Gray argues that, contra Rawls, "the appropriate conception of the person for historical circumstance is closer to that
which Hobbes presented at a time of profound religious conflict" (1988, p. 181) We will see that Gray returns to this
theme in his most recent book.


### Post-Liberalism

#### Hayek

In "Hayek as a conservative" Gray notes that "Hayek's position is distinctive, to be sure" (1996, p. 32), and that "Hayek's
attempt to synthesize the deepest insights of conservatism with the best elements of classical liberalism merits our
closest scrutiny" (1996, p. 33)

"The dominant superstition of the Age of Reason is the belief that vital social institutions – law, language, and
morality, as well as the market – must be or can become products of conscious contrivance and control, if they are
effectively to serve human purposes" (1996, p. 36)

Hayek's "chief importance... is that he has freed classical liberalism from the burden of an hubristic rationalism"
(1996, p. 37)

"trying to salvage damaged traditions by willful effort is like trying with one's bare hands to repair a broken spider's
web" (1996, p. 38)

"At times [Hayek] seems to subscribe to a doctrine of historical progress which... cannot be endorsed by any twentieth
century conservative" (1996, p. 38)

"since much of contemporary culture is possessed by a death-wish brought on by pathological developments in some of our
oldest traditions, a modern conservative must also be a moral and intellectual radical" (1996, p. 39)

#### Oakeshott

"[Oakeshott's] first lesson is that the hubristic project of doctrinal or fundamental liberalism – the project attempted by all
the liberal thinkers... of fixing the boundaries of government action by some principle or doctrine, be it
*laissez-faire*, a specification of allegedly natural (but patently conventional) rights, or a list of basic liberties
derived (as in Rawls and Dworkin) from a conception of justice rooted only in the fleeting local knowledge of the
American academic *nomenklatura* — embodies a mistaken conception of philosophy itself" (1996, 41).

Writing about Oakeshott's distinction between civil association and enterprise association, Gray remarks:
"the debacles of Thatcherism and Reaganism suggest that, for us, the enterprise-association state is an historical fate,
which we may indeed strive to temper, but which we cannot hope to overcome" (1996, p. 44).
One can gather from that passage that Gray was not pleased by the outcome of Thatcherism and Reaganism. Indeed, 
during the 1990s, Gray was associated with New Labour -- the center-left movement
that brought Tony Blair to power in Westminster -- and he became a prominent critic of global capitalism with his 1998
book *False Dawn*.

#### Buchanan

An important lesson Gray takes from Buchanan is that, contra Hayek, spontaneous social orders will not reliably be
beneficial, without the aid of deliberately constructed institutions designed to make them so. For instance, Gray argues
that after the collapse of communist states in eastern Europe, "we cannot intrust ourselves to the providential designs
of Burkean or Hayekian institutional evolution. Rather, armed with the best theory we can find, we must wager on a new
social contract" (1996, p. 53).

Gray closes his Buchanan essay on a more optimistic note than he will sound in much of his later work, writing, 
"we must wager on liberty by seeking, amid all the vicissitudes and contingencies of practice, a new constitutional
settlement on limited government, in which free men and women may live in voluntary association – in liberty under the
rule of law" (1996, p. 63).


#### Berlin

In Gray's essay on Isaiah Berlin we can detect the genesis of another phase of Gray's thought: here we see him embrace
Berlin's value pluralism:

"Berlin's work, both in intellectual history and political theory, is one which, if true, as I take it to be, strikes a
death-blow to the central, classical Western tradition -- and, it must be added, to the project of the
Enlightenment. Berlin's master idea is that ultimate values are objective and knowable, but they are many, they often
come into conflict with one another and are uncombinable in a single human being or a single society, and that in many
of such conflicts there is no overarching standard whereby the competing claims of such ultimate values are rationally
arbitratable...  There is, then, no *summum bonum* or *logos*, no Aristotelian mean or Platonic form of the good, no
perfect form of human life, which we may never achieve, but towards which we may struggle, no measuring rod on which
different forms of human life encompassing different and uncombinable goods can be ranked." (1996, p. 65)

This is a puzzling passage. At least as Gray presents Berlin, we have here a *petitio principii*: what is supposedly the
conclusion of the argument is, in fact, one of its premises, because it is only if there is, indeed, no "*summum bonum*
or *logos*" that such conflicts are not "rationally arbitratable." After all, Plato and Aristotle and Aquinas, among
many others, acknowlegded that there are people who resist the pull of the *logos* and therefore are immune to rational
argumentation as to what is truly good.  Whether Berlin manages to avoid this question begging
in his work is beyond the scope of this introduction, but at least we can say that Gray does not offer us any reason to
think that he has.

In any case, it is clear that Gray *does* accept this conclusion of Berlin's, and, we suggest, that is extremely
important in understanding his subsequent work. he goes on to say:

"Berlin at the same time, cuts the ground from under those doctrinal or fundamentalist liberalisms — the liberalism of
Nozick or Hayek no less than of Rawls or Ackerman — which suppose that the incommensurabilities of moral and political
life, and of liberty itself, can be smoothed away by the application of some theory, or tamed by some talismanic
formula... if there is any liberalism, that is now defensible, it is Berlin's." (1996, p. 67)

Among other things, the above passage is notable for illustrating Gray's decreasing enthusiasm for Hayek.

#### Cultural Diversity

In "The politics of cultural diversity," an essay as relevant today as when it was written, Gray argues that The
progressive enthusiasm for what they call "multiculturalism" is "animated by moral hatred of the dominant traditions,
and a voyeuristic fascination with submerged, overwhelmed, or oppositional, cultures." Therefore, it seeks to "entrench
Minority traditions in protected institutions and confer on them arbitrary privileges" (1996, p. 266).

### Endgames


The essay "The Strange Death of Tory England" deals with the British Conservative party undermining its own base by
embracing neoliberalism. While much of the essay deals with particulars of British politics, it does further illustrate
Gray's move away from Thatcherism, as well as presenting an example of the truth that unfettered markets are not
friendly towards social cohesion.

The next essay, "After Social Democracy," argues that, whether one approves or disapprove of Thatcherism, its
"consequences for political life in Britain" are "irreversible" (1997, p. 11). Gray sees no possibility of Britain
reverting to a pre-Thatcher form of social democracy or traditional conservatism; instead, the correct focus of
practical political thought is "What is Thatcherism's successor?" (1997, p. 11)

Gray contends that while social democracy was once a workable alternative to Soviet communism and American
individualism,  "the billions of skilled workers released onto the global market by the communist collapse and the
disappearance of any effective barriers to global mobility of capital" have rendered it "a bankrupt project" (1997, p.
13). Gray also rejects the project of right-wingers (such as John Redwood) who seek to revive traditional cultural forms
that have mostly vanished.

As an alternative, he recommends "a communitarian liberal perspective" which "enriches standard liberal philosophy with
the distinctive insights of communitarian thought" (1997, p. 15). He hopes this will balance the human need for security
and forms of common life with people's "demand... to make their own choices and to be at least part-authors of their own
lives" (1997, p. 16). This latter requirement is, of course, incompatible with the denial of free will that Gray will
adopt later: if free will is an illusion, we no more make choices than does a rock tumbling down a hill. Furthermore,
this few of our choices as "autonomous" ignores the insights of Rene Girard into the mimetic nature of our desires.
[cite!!!]

A central component of "the communitarian liberal view… is that market freedoms have instrumental value only, as a means
to individual well-being" (1997, p. 17). And "in contrast with social democracy, which has extended to social welfare
rights the supposedly unconditional claims of negative liberal rights, the communitarian view affirms the dependency of
individual autonomy on a strong network of reciprocal obligations" (1997, p. 18). The goal is "reconciling the human
need for security with the permanent revolution of the market" (1997, p. 19).

Gray notes that "It is a comment on the parochialism of British political life that social democrats have accepted the
Thatcherite claim that opposition to European federalism is the prerogative of the Right" (1997, pp. 34-35).  This was a
prescient remark, given how a decade later, Brexit was cast as a right-wing initiative.

In his essay "Rawl's Anti-Political Liberalism," Gray knocks Rawls off of his pedestal in a few pithy sentences. He
succinctly describes the difference between Hobbes and Rawls:

"For Hobbes, the goal of political philosophy is not to come up with an apology for any particular political regime. It is
instead to understand the universal and permanent human needs that political institutions of all sorts exist to meet...
The contrast with Rawls's political liberalism could hardly be starker... Rawls takes as his point of departure... the
institutions common among American East Coast liberal academics" (1997, p. 53).

In the end, Gray notes, "The most striking feature of Rawls's political liberalism is its utter political emptiness"
(1997, p. 54).


#### Oakeshott and Berlin

In "Berlin, Oakeshott, and Enlightenment," Gray undertakes an interesting comparison of these two prominent critics of
rationalism. But he misunderstands Oakeshott in a fundamental way when he writes, "If, for Oakeshott, all forms of
knowledge are at bottom practical..." (1997, p. 86). But Oakeshott quite explicitly rejects that view, writing "The
world of practice... will be found to be abstracting defective from the standpoint of the totality of experience...
[and] that (consequently) it is without any direct relationship with other abstract worlds of experience, such as those of
science and history..." (Oakeshott 1933, p. 249). One might respond, "Well, that is just the early Oakeshott," were it
not the case that he again, forty-two years later, rejects the idea that theory can be reduced to practice (Oakeshott
1975, pp. 29-30).


#### Beginnings

The most glaring weakness in Gray's thought is the repeated mistaking of the theory of evolution, a biological model of
how lifeforms change over time, as something with vast implications for metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, and philosophical
anthropology. An example occurs in "Beginnings," the last essay in *Endgames*:

"It is difficult to reconcile [science as truth seeking] with the results of scientific inquiry, such as Darwinism. In a
consistently Darwinian perspective, science will seek truth only in so far as truth serves human interests" (1997, p. 168).

The problem Gray's case faces here is that if what he says about science is true, there is no reason to acquit Darwinism
of the charge he levels at all other scientific theories. And that would mean we have no particular reason to think that
Darwinism is true; rather, it has been devised to help evolutionary biologists find mates, gain social prestige, and so
on. And that makes his argument self-undermining. (I will note here that I think Darwinism is a pretty good theory, albeit
one likely to be eventually superceded by an even better theory, but that is because I do believe that science is truth
seeking.)


### False Dawn


### Two Faces of Liberalism

Gray opens this work by noting that "The liberal state or originated in a search for *modus vivendi*" (2000, p. 1),
meaning a way people with divergent views can somehow co-exist.
And he declares that "Liberal toleration has contributed immeasurably to human well-being" (2000, p. 1).

But then he makes the quite important distinction between two liberal approaches to tolerance:
"Viewed from one side, liberal toleration is the ideal of a rational consensus on the best way of life. From the other,
it is the belief that human beings can flourish in many ways of life... If liberalism has a future, it is in giving up
the search for a rational consensus on the best way of life" (2000, p. 1).

He makes it clear that he embraces the second approach, and not the first:

"The liberal ideal of toleration which looks to a rational consensus on the best way of life was born in societies
divided on the claims of a single way of life. It cannot show us how to live together in societies that harbour many
ways of life" (2000, pp. 1-2).

Gray then offers examples of prominent thinkers exhibiting these different forms of liberal tolerance:

"The philosophies of John Locke and Immanuel Kant exemplify the liberal project of a universal regime, while those of
Thomas Hobbes and David Hume express the liberalism of peaceful coexistence. And more recent times, John Rawls and F.A.
Hayek have defended the first liberal philosophy, while Isaiah Berlin and Michael Oakeshott are exemplars of the
second" (2000, p. 2).

he goes on to write that, "In this Hobbesian view [of the second sort of thinkers], the end of tolerance is not
consensus. It is coexistence" (2000, p. 3).

Gray then claims, "*Modus vivendi* expresses the belief that there are many forms of life in which humans can thrive...
Where such ways of life are rivals, there is no one of them that is best" (2000, p. 5).

This may be true, but here it is not argued for but merely assumed. And on its face, the assumption seems false: for
instance, are we really wrong to regard the new ways of life that arose during what has been called "the Axial Age"
(Jaspers, 2014), when religions arose that regarded all humans, and not merely some particular tribe or nation, as of
equal moral worth, are ethically superior to their predecessors? (And we can recognize that, while Jaspers placing this
transformation in a narrow band of a few centuries is too limiting, there was a broader change that took place in the
space of a millennium or so.) After all, humans "thrived" in the pre-Axial societies, at least in the sense that the
human population increased and humans came to inhabit more and more of the earth's lands. And, in fact, Gray's search
for a *modus vivendi* which will allow humans pursuing different ways of life to co-exist is an implicit acceptance of
the Axial Age advance in human ethical consciousness, and assumes that the ways of life it created *are* better than the
more tribalistic ways of life they replaced.

Gray, of course, perceives this problem, and hopes to solve it by noting that "Not all ways of life allow humans to live
well. There are universal human goods and evils. Some virtues are needed for any kind of human flourishing" (2000, p.
8). So, presumably, Gray would argue that, say, the Mafia's way of life fails to recognize these universal human goods
and evils, and therefore need not be tolerated. But this has simply raised the problem of liberal universal
agreement to a higher level: this regime requires near-unanimty on just what virtues are required for any kind
of human flourishing, and, furthermore, just what constitutes human flourishing. Some people might declare that humans are
flourishing if they are healthy. Others will further require that they are materially prosperous, or that they be
intellectually stimulated, or have open to them the path to enlightenment, or the opportunity to end the ceaseless cycle
of death and rebirth, or to achieve salvation through God's grace.

Gray's treatment of abortion is symptomatic of this problem. In discussing "fundamentalists," he treats one mark of
fundamentalism as talking about "the right to life" (2000, p. 14). (And Gray actually puts the phrase in scare quotes.)
But it is not obvious why this is not itself the very sort of universal good Gray already acknowledged.
For instance, the great liberal philosopher T.H. Green declared such a right a modern advance, writing
of how, in the ancient world, "the exposure of children was everywhere practiced... a practice in strong contrast with the
principal of modern law that even a child in the womb has a right to live" (Green 1986, p. 119).
For the "fundamentalists" who wish to see abortion banned, their aim, as they understand it, is certainly pro-autonomy: the
right to autonomy of the fetus is most definitely wiped out by killing it. Gray might argue that the fetus is not a
person, and thus has no such rights. But that just illustrates that there is no consensus on vital points that Gray
assumes we can agree upon to establish his *modus vivendi*.

He goes on to state that "Liberals and pluralists walk side-by-side in resisting totalitarian and fundamentalist
regimes... It is a mark of an illiberal regime that conflicts of value are viewed as signs of error" (2000, p. 20).

But of course Gray is viewing what he calls "fundamentalism" as a sign of error. And for him, the category "fundamentalist"
apparently includes all the adherents of universal religions (such as Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism), as he says
that "universal religions are incompatible with the truth of value-pluralism" (2000, p. 21). But this
means that well over one half of the world's population hold views that are incompatible with value-pluralism. And
therefore Gray's preferred regime tolerates all of their ways of life just so long as they don't take their own
religion's claim to universality all that seriously. (See Finnis 2011 for the case that there is no such incompatibility
between value pluralism and universal religions.)

That problem could be sidestepped, however: One could heartily agree with Gray that a *modus vivendi* political regime is
the best course in our current circumstances, while rejecting his case for value pluralism. For instance, one might hold
that a Christian polity would be superior to our current regimes, *if* such a thing were achievable. But given that
ideal is unrealistic, the Christian virtue of prudence recommends we accept a *modus vivendi* regime.

Gray, I can contend, has conflated two separate claims:

1. There is no rational way to choose between different ways of life; and
2. Our best political option at present is a *modus vivendi* regime.

The case for the second claim does not depend on the first claim being true; in fact, I suggest it is actually weakened
by being lashed to the first one, since tying them together weakens the appeal of the second claim for those who reject
the first.


## Staring into the Void


### Straw Dogs

*Straw Dogs* is one of Gray's most popular books. In it, a "gloomy Gray" comes to the forefront. A lot of this gloom
turns on Gray's interpretation of Darwinism and his reading of its implications, but both are questionable.

The book opens with several curious assertions. First, he writes "Darwin teaches that species are only assemblies of
genes, interacting at random with each other and their shifting environments" (2007, p. 3).

But Darwin had no concept of genes at all. Mendel's work on genes was unknown to him, and was not incorporated into the
mainstream of evolutionary theory until well after Darwin's death.
And even if Gray is using "Darwin" as a synecdoche for "modern Darwinian theory," there is still a problem: in modern
evolutionary theory, it is not true that evolution is purely random. As Richard Dawkins put it, "Darwinism
is a theory of random mutation plus *nonrandom* cumulative natural selection" (Dawkins, 1996, p. 75).

Gray next assigns Christianity a unique status among world religions in believing that there is a significant difference
between humans and other animals, and holds it thus responsible for Darwin's theory being at all controversial. However,
quite clearly Judaism and Islam, sharing the Old Testament with Christianity, also differentiate humans from other
animals. But then, so did Aristotle, giving humans a unique character as "the rational animal." True, in religions that
include the idea of reincarnation, it is often thought that souls may move between human and non-human lives in
successive reincarnations. But Buddhism, for instance, regards human reincarnations as special in their openness to the
possibility of enlightenment, since humans, possessing reason, have the ability to grasp the dharma
(Norbu et al. 2020, pp. 19-26). Gray specifically cites Hinduism as a religion in which humans are not special, but
hinduamerican.org says "Mankind, because it is believed to be the most spiritually evolved, thus carries a special
responsibility..." (Hindu American Foundation).

He then describes the idea that "salvation is open to all" as "one of Christianity's most dubious promises" (2007, p.
4). We can grant that, *if* humans are just an outcome of random, material forces, that salvation is open to no one, since
there is no such thing. But why then include the proviso "open to all"? In Gray's view, is salvation open to some but
not to others?

Gray then claims, "in the world shown us by Darwin, there is nothing that can be called progress" (2007, p. 4).
But Darwin himself clearly believed in progress, for example: "And as natural selection works solely by and for the good
of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection." (1872, Chapter XV, par. 55)

Gray, in another work, claims that the existence of a passage like the above is due to "Darwins inability always to
accept the logic of his own theory" (2018, p. 55). However, it could be equally due to Darwin recognizing that the fact
that a theory does not make use of some concept, such as "progress," does not mean that concept has no application
anywhere: it simply means it is not a part of that theory. Just like with progress, Darwin's theory also does not
contain the concept of music.  That hardly shows that music does not exist.

He next claims that "Christianity's cardinal error" is that "humans are different from all other animals" (2007, p. 4).

And yet, as we have seen, this same "error" is present in many traditions. In fact, as Chesterton pointed out, a good
empirically grounded alien, arriving on earth, would immediately recognize that humans are different from all other
animals. [cite].

Recognizing this empirical fact does not immediately yield any metaphysical implications. Recognizing that volcanoes are
different from all other mountains would not mean that we have to grant them some superior ontological status. But
nevertheless, it would be a very poor geologist who did not recognize this significant difference.

In fact, the very "error" that Gray is at pains to criticize demonstrates that his contention that this an error is
wrong: no elephant or chimpanzee or dolphin has ever developed a metaphysics in which their species is marked out as
different from all other animals, rendering their misapprehension in need of correction by a dour British
philosopher.

"if the human species is re-engineered it will not be the result of humanity assuming a God like control of its destiny.
It will be another twist in man's fate" (2007, p. 6).

"'Darwin's dice have rolled badly for the Earth,' Wilson points out." (2007, p. 7).

But given it is all meaningless chance events, what is "bad" about even all life on earth being wiped out? There was
never a point to it anyway.

"Epidemiology and microbiology are better guides to our future than any of our hopes or plans" (2007, p. 9).

Note the radical change in tone!


"the human population growth that has taken place over the past few hundred years resembles nothing so much as the
spikes that occur in the numbers of rabbits, house mice and plague rats" (2007, p. 10).

Gray should be read by every techno-optimist.

"Once a technology enters human life – whether it be fire, the wheel, the automobile, radio, television or the Internet
– it changes it in ways we can never fully understand" (2007, p. 14).


"Technical progress leaves only one problem unsolved: the frailty of human nature. Unfortunately that problem is
insoluble" (2007, p. 15).

"Green thinkers understand that humans can never be masters of the Earth. Yet in their Ludfite struggle against
technology they renew the illusion that the world can be made the instrument of human purposes" (2007, p. 15).

"As Margulis and Sagan have written, we are ourselves technological devices, invented by ancient bacterial communities
as means of genetic survival" (2007, p. 16).

It is weird to describe ancient bacterial communities as "inventing" multicellular organisms when previously Gray has
described evolution as just genes randomly interacting with each other. Furthermore, while he holds that it is an
illusion that humans can shape the world to their purposes, apparently bacteria could do so.

"If our lives are to have any meaning, the power of science must be overthrown, and faith re-established" (2007, p. 18).

As someone who seriously studied Hayek, Gray ought to recognize that the problem here is not science, but scientism. And
his familiarity with Oakeshott ought to have alerted him to the fact that positing a conflict between science and
religion is an ignoratio elenchi.

Gray notes that today, "science alone has the power to silence heretics" (2007, p. 19).

Gray calls the idea that science triumphed in the battle of ideas because it is "the embodiment of rational inquiry" a "fairy tale" (2007, p. 21).

He argues (correctly) that "Galileo won out not because he had the best arguments but because he was able to represent
the new astronomy as part of a coming trend in society" (2007, p. 21).






### The Immortalization Commission


In his book *The Immortalization Commission: Science and the Strange Quest to Cheat Death*, Gray 


Gray moves on from expatiating upon the "message" of Darwinism to describe the two historical episodes that are the
core, as well as the far more interesting portion, of this work. He tells these stories with great panache, making for
lively reading. He first takes up the case of the British parapsychologists active in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. This group included many prominent figures, such as the great ethical theorist Henry Sidgwick, the
classical scholar Frederic Meyers, the Irish poet W.B. Yeats, and British foreign secretary and prime minister Arthur
Balfour. They looked to science to replace religion as the guarantor of man's immortality by seeking empirical evidence
of life after death, most often by trying to receive messages from the departed that convincingly could demonstrate
their continued existence. The most fascinating example of this effort involved automatic writing, a practice in which a
person would write down what were supposed to be messages from beyond the grave, purportedly without conscious awareness
of what they were writing. Over a number of years this practice yield "many thousands" of pages of automatic writing,
which were thought to display "cross-correspondences," so that something written down by one medium formed a complete
message only when put together with the messages transcribed by several others. In the end, the experiment was
inclusive, since the interpretation of the supposed messages was not a determinate matter; to some people they were
clear evidence of an afterlife, while for others, including, seemingly, Gray, they are much more indicative of the
shared subconscious mental life of the writers. Members of the group also involved themselves in attempts to create a
new messiah, a spirit child who would lead mankind to new spiritual heights.

The next chapter of *The Immortalization Commission* deals with the important role occultism played in the Soviet Union
before World War II. This is the section from which the book's title is drawn: the Soviet Union actually established a
commission with that name, as well as a Soviet Committee for Psychical Research. The embalming of Lenin's dead body was
performed largely with this goal of achieving immortality through science in mind. The government went so far, in its
efforts to establish an immortality cult centered on Lenin, as to distribute cubes, with the aim of every subject of the
regime having their own little version of Lenin's cubical shrine in their homes.



### The Soul of the Marionette


A spirit of "nihilistic stoicism" suffuses his 2015 book, *The Soul of the
Marionette*. In these pages he undertakes a sort of jazz improvisation on the theme of human freedom, surveying an
omnium-gatherum of earlier writers' and cultures' thoughts on the topic from the point of view of a "freedom-skeptic." 


### Seven Types of Atheism

In his book *Seven Types of Atheism*, Gray makes the important point that atheism is not a single doctrine, but
encompasses a wide variety -- at least seven -- of world views.

In his first chapter, Gray addresses is the "New Atheists." He is at his best here, and few believers could write as
sscathing a takedown of this movement. As he puts it:

"The new atheists have directed their campaign against a narrow segment of religion while failing to understand even
that small part. Seeing religion as a system of beliefs, they have attacked it as if it was no more than an obsolete
scientific theory... But the idea that religion consists of a bunch of discredited theories is itself a discredited
theory -- a relic of the 19th century philosophy of Positivism." (2018, p. 9)

And he goes on to note that "The Genesis story is not an early theory of the origin of species" (2018, p. 11).

As Gray demonstrates, the new atheists, far from being irreligious, are followers of Auguste Comte's "religion of
humanity," a cult the French thinker created in the 19th century that contained its own positivist rites and sacraments.

The next variety of atheism that Gray addresses is secular humanism. He convincingly argues that the belief in continued
human progress, divorced from its Biblical roots, is just the echoing death rattles of our Christian civilization.

Gray, however, mistakenly forwards the common idea that all cultures without the Bible as their sacred scripture have a
cyclical understanding of history. As Eric Voegelin wrote:

"When I devise the program, I was still laboring under the conventional belief that the conception of history has a
meeting for Kristin events on a straight line of time is the great achievement of Israelites and Christians... while
the pagans... could never rise above the conception of a cyclical time. This conventional believe had to be abandoned
when I discovered the unilinear construction of history... developed by the end of the third millennium B.C. in the
empires of the Ancient Near East." (Voegelin 2000, p. 51)

Gray closes his chapter on secular humanism with a critique of Ayn Rand, in which he demonstrates the roots of her
"cod-philosophy" (2018, p. 51) in the work of Nietzsche, while noting how ridiculous her cults' embrace of such habits as
smoking cigarettes with a filter and esteeming tap dancing above all other dances were.

Gray next chapter, "A Strange Faith in Science," takes on those who make a religion out of science. The first part of
the chapter discusses the roots of modern racism in the Enlightenment, noting that Hume, Kant and Voltaire all were
quite explicitly racist, and that this racism continued in several "scientific" forms well into the twentieth century.

The last part of the chapter deals with transhumanism, which Gray refers to as "techno-monotheism" (2018, p. 66), and
"religion recycled as science" (2018, p. 67). He argues that even if the transhumanist touted technologies come to
fruition, the result will be not one "Supreme Being... [but] many different gods, each of them a parody of human beings
that once existed" (2018, p. 70).

In a chapter on "God-Haters," Gray demonstrates his ability to unearth obscure but curious anecdotes from the byways of
history that help illustrate a theme he is exploring. In this case, gray turns to the life and work of English literary
critic and poet William Empson. Empson was, indeed, a "God hater," writing "The Christian God the Father... is the
wickedest thing yet invented by the black heart of man" (quoted in Gray 2018, p. 117). Yet Empson had an affinity for
Buddhism, despite regarding it as "more life-negating and in this regard even worse than Christianity" (quoted in Gray
2018, p. 122). Gray sagely remarks that Empson saw "The irreducible plurality of meaning and value in language in art...
In the contradictory expressions of the Buddha. He was too close to Christianity to see it there to" (2018, p. 123). And
the rest of that paragraph significantly softens earlier criticisms he has made of Christianity.


### Feline Philosophy

In the recent work *Feline Philosophy*, Gray compares the attitude of cats towards the world with that of humans, and
finds that, as a whole, that of cats is better.

For one thing, cats have no concept of morality; humans believe they do, but they are mistaken.
Gray claims that when people talk of morality, "what they are doing is expressing their emotions" (2020, p. 46). This
metaethical theory is known as emotivism, and was popularized by A.J. Ayer (1946). It is a departure from Gray's earlier
"moral realism but pluralism."

If there is one outstanding feature of Gray's work that sets it apart, it is his continual willingness to rethink and
change earlier positions he had taken. Well, this is certainly a laudable tree, that does not mean that every change has
been for the better. And this is a case where it has not, because emotivism is mistaken, regardless of whether there are
objective moral facts or not. Consider someone who says "Adultery is wrong": they are *not* just expressing a negative
emotion they feel towards adultery. For instance, it is quite possible for someone to say, "I know adultery is wrong,
but boy do I love it!" No, when someone utters a sentence like that, they are claiming that there is *a fact of the
matter* about adultery being wrong. Now, they might be mistaken in their claim, just as I might claim, "There is a man
hiding behind that tree" when there is no such man there. But my sentence was not a description of some emotion I was
experiencing; it was a fact claim, but one that happened to be incorrect. (See Brandt 1959 and Geach 1960 for further
arguments against emotivism.)

Attempting to back his advocacy of emotivism,
Gray notes while it was once thought to be moral to use imperial power to spread civilization, that is now considered
immoral. But simply pointing out the people have had different opinions on some topic at different times in no way shows
that no opinion is more truthful than any other. Some people think that all living creatures popped into existence in a
single act of creation that took place 6000 years ago. Others believe that all living forms evolved from simple
creatures that appeared on earth over 3 billion years ago. Would Gray argue that this difference of opinion means that
no view on the matter is better than any other?

Gray might respond that morality is not like science in this regard. But that answer is question begging: whether it is
or isn't is the point of contention, and Gray certainly cannot show that there are no better or worse 
answers to moral questions simply by showing that there are different answers.

Gray contrasts the idea of morality found, for instance, in Christianity, with that of the Chinese ideal of "living
according to *tao*" (2020, p. 47). But this ignores the deep similarities between Taoism and Christianity, as
demonstrated by, e.g., Damascene 2002 or Lewis 1974..

In the last chapter of *Feline Philosophy*, Gray offers ten "feline hints" (2020, pp. 108-111). All of them are
interesting, and many of them strike me as fairly sound. But entire list rests uneasily with feline commandment
number nine, which advises "Beware anyone who offers to make you happy": isn't that what Gray (or his cat?) is doing
with this list?

After these ten hints, he writes, "Eternity is not another order of things, but the world seen without anxiety"
(2020, p. 111). This is a profound insight; one might be tempted to call it "religious." And indeed, one can find this
idea also expressed by Buddha and Christ.


### The New Leviathans

Gray's most recent book is *The New Leviathans: Thoughts After Liberalism*.

It is as though the reader has been invited to eavesdrop on Gray's inner dialogues as he mulls over a post-liberal world.

In a book the title of which contains the word "Leviathan," we naturally would expect Thomas Hobbes to play an important
role, and indeed he does. Throughout his meditations, Gray brings up Hobbes again and again. In fact, if one were to be
so bold and foolish enough to offer a "central message" of the book, it might be that the circumstances that prompted
Hobbes to write *Leviathan* have again become salient in our time. The liberal world order that prevailed for some years
after the fall of the Soviet Union is collapsing around us.

Gray first addresses Hobbes by noting that: "Hobbes was a liberal – the only one, perhaps, still worth reading." In
defense of the first half of this claim, he presents the four characteristics of liberalism provided in his own book,
Liberalism, to wit, liberalism is:

- individualist
- egalitarian
- universalist
- meliorist

And he goes on to argue that the above key liberal ideas are present in Hobbes in that, for him:

- "Society is made up of individuals..."
- "[each] equal in being exposed to death at each other's hands..."
- "Human nature is universal in its needs..."
- "With the application of reason, government can be improved..."

Thus Hobbes is "the" proto-liberal. However, as Gray explains, "Each of these [liberal] ideas is a half-truth":

Individuals are the basis of society, but "self-preservation is only one of their needs: bare life is not enough."

Human beings "regularly give up peace and security in order to defend a form of life..."

"The most basic human goods may be universal but they are often sacrificed..."

"Society and government can be improved, but what is gained can always be lost... There is no complete or final exit from
the state of nature."

Gray's claim that Hobbes was a liberal may disconcert some who have interpreted him as a totalitarian. But here Gray
makes a crucial, often overlooked, point about Hobbes, "Hobbes's was a state whose powers were unchecked, but its goals
were strictly limited. Beyond securing its subjects against one another and external enemies, it had no remit."
In other words, Hobbes's sovereign existed to keep its citizens from
going to war with each other, and had whatever power it needed to meet that task. But its area of authority did not
include stopping them from smoking, or encouraging them to exercise, or urging them to approve of
transgenderism, or prompting them to read more. (Unless, of course, one of those projects was
necessary to maintain civil peace: For instance, if smokers and non-smokers were engaging in pitched battles in the streets,
Hobbes's sovereign might need to take a stand on the issue of smoking.)



## Conclusion


One of the results of reading (or re-reading) much of Gray's ouvre in writing this paper is amazement at the
scope of material he has digested: he appears to not only have read everything you have, but also everything three or four
of your colleagues have as well. That, combined with the startling amount of work he has published, makes one wonder
about the nihilism that he seemingly adopts in some of his output. After all, if "it" is all meaningless, why has Gray
spent so much time and effort gifting us with such an extensive, insightful, and provocative body of work?

## Notes


*******

Rather than straightforward histories, or philosophical or political arguments, or personal reminiscences, Gray 
has adopted an approach to his more recent non-fiction work similar to the one that
Milan Kundera took to his novels. These books are meditations on a
topic, approaching it through a variety of vantage points: some anecdotes, some historical episodes briefly narrated, a
few interesting (and sometimes horrifying) statistics, a witty or trenchant aperçu here, a brief argument there. It
worked for Kundera's novels, and it also works when essayed by Gray.
