# John Gray's Life and Work

Gene Callahan

*************

[From Wikipedia]

Gray studied at Exeter College, Oxford, reading philosophy, politics and economics (PPE), completing his B.A., Masters of Philosophy. and Doctorate in Philosophy.

He held posts as lecturer in political theory at the University of Essex, fellow and tutor in politics at Jesus
College, Oxford, and lecturer and then professor of politics at the University of Oxford. He has served as a visiting
professor at Harvard University (1985–86) and Stranahan Fellow at the Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green
State University (1990–1994), and has also held visiting professorships at Tulane University's Murphy Institute (1991)
and Yale University (1994). He was Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics and Political Science
until his retirement from academic life in early 2008.

He began his intellectual life on the left but moved right in the late 1970s, becoming a fan of Nobel Prize-winning free-market
economist F.A. Hayek.

Gray's libertarianism was tempered, however, by studying British philosopher Michael Oakeshott's
critique of "rationalism in politics." (Gray wrote of him: "Michael Oakeshott [is] clearly one of the most original and
profound British political philosophers since Hume and certainly this century's greatest conservative writer" [1996: p. 40].)


## Liberalisms

A key document of this shift was his 1988 work, *Liberalisms*. It is a collection of essays written over a period of a dozen
years. As Gray describes the essays, "They embody a single project, pursued continuously over the period in which they
were written -- the project of defining liberalism and giving it a foundation." But, for liberalism, the conclusion was not a
happy one: "The enterprise ended in failure" (Gray 1988, p. vii).

"the move away from a political philosophy with the universalist, pretensions as a desirable, or at any rate an inevitable move" 168

But this is a move away from political philosophy, not a positive of a different kind of political philosophy. See Bosanquet and Oakeshott.

Gray notes that, prior to the breakdown of the Western consensus the most salient event of which was the Reformation,
"the liberal problem of establishing fair principles of social cooperation among persons having incompatible and
incommensurable conceptions of the good — does not exist" (1988, p. 169).


Gray argues against Rawl's contention that justice is silent about the choice of economic system.
Gray's analysis of the unstable and inefficient nature of market socialism displays a deep understanding of the
calculation argument forwarded by Mises and Hayek, far surpassing that of today's average economist.


Gray argues that, contra Rawls, "the appropriate conception of the person for historical circumstance is closer to that
which Hobbes presented at a time of profound religious conflict" (1988, p. 181) We will see that Gray returns to this
theme in his most recent book.


## Post-Liberalism


### Hayek

In "Hayek as a conservative" Gray notes that "Hayek's position is distinctive, to be sure" (1996, p. 32), and that "Hayek's
attempt to synthesize the deepest insights of conservatism with the best elements of classical liberalism merits our
closest scrutiny" (1996, p. 33)

"The dominant superstition of the Age of Reason is the belief that vital social institutions – law, language, and
morality, as well as the market – must be or can become products of conscious contrivance and control, if they are
effectively to serve human purposes" (1996, p. 36)

Hayek's "chief importance... is that he has freed classical liberalism from the burden of an hubristic rationalism"
(1996, p. 37)

"trying to salvage damaged traditions by willful effort is like trying with one's bare hands to repair a broken spider's
web" (1996, p. 38)

"At times [Hayek] seems to subscribe to a doctrine of historical progress which... cannot be endorsed by any twentieth
century conservative" (1996, p. 38)

"since much of contemporary culture is possessed by a death-wish brought on by pathological developments in some of our
oldest traditions, a modern conservative must also be a moral and intellectual radical" (1996, p. 39)

### Oakeshott

"[Oakeshott's] first lesson is that the hubristic project of doctrinal or fundamental liberalism – the project attempted by all
the liberal thinkers... of fixing the boundaries of government action by some principle or doctrine, be it
*laissez-faire*, a specification of allegedly natural (but patently conventional) rights, or a list of basic liberties
derived (as in Rawls and Dworkin) from a conception of justice rooted only in the fleeting local knowledge of the
American academic *nomenklatura* — embodies a mistaken conception of philosophy itself" (1996, 41).

Writing about Oakeshott's distinction between civil association and enterprise association, Gray remarks:
"the debacles of Thatcherism and Reaganism suggest that, for us, the enterprise-association state is an historical fate,
which we may indeed strive to temper, but which we cannot hope to overcome" (1996, p. 44).
One can gather from that passage that Gray was not pleased by the outcome of Thatcherism and Reaganism. Indeed, 
during the 1990s, Gray was associated with New Labour -- the center-left movement
that brought Tony Blair to power in Westminster -- and he became a prominent critic of global capitalism with his 1998
book *False Dawn*.

### Buchanan

An important lesson Gray takes from Buchanan is that, contra Hayek, spontaneous social orders will not reliably be
beneficial, without the aid of deliberately constructed institutions designed to make them so. For instance, Gray argues
that after the collapse of communist states in eastern Europe, "we cannot intrust ourselves to the providential designs
of Burkean or Hayekian institutional evolution. Rather, armed with the best theory we can find, we must wager on a new
social contract" (1996, p. 53).

Gray closes his Buchanan essay on a more optimistic note than he will sound in much of his later work, writing, 
"we must wager on liberty by seeking, amid all the vicissitudes and contingencies of practice, a new constitutional
settlement on limited government, in which free men and women may live in voluntary association – in liberty under the
rule of law" (1996, p. 63).



### Berlin

In Gray's essay on Isaiah Berlin we can detect the genesis of another phase of Gray's thought: here we see him embrace
Berlin's value pluralism:

"Berlin's work, both in intellectual history and political theory, is one which, if true, as I take it to be, strikes a
death-blow to the central, classical Western tradition -- and, it must be added, to the project of the
Enlightenment. Berlin's master idea is that ultimate values are objective and knowable, but they are many, they often
come into conflict with one another and are uncombinable in a single human being or a single society, and that in many
of such conflicts there is no overarching standard whereby the competing claims of such ultimate values are rationally
arbitratable...  There is, then, no *summum bonum* or *logos*, no Aristotelian mean or Platonic form of the good, no
perfect form of human life, which we may never achieve, but towards which we may struggle, no measuring rod on which
different forms of human life encompassing different and uncombinable goods can be ranked." (1996, p. 65)

This is a puzzling passage. At least as Gray presents Berlin, we have here a *petitio principii*: what is supposedly the
conclusion of the argument is, in fact, one of its premises, because it is only if there is, indeed, no "*summum bonum*
or *logos*" that such conflicts are not "rationally arbitratable." After all, Plato and Aristotle and Aquinas, among
many others, acknowlegded that there are people who resist the pull of the *logos* and therefore are immune to rational
argumentation as to what is truly good.  Whether Berlin manages to avoid this question begging
in his work is beyond the scope of this introduction, but at least we can say that Gray does not offer us any reason to
think that he has.

In any case, it is clear that Gray *does* accept this conclusion of Berlin's, and, we suggest, that is extremely
important in understanding his subsequent work. he goes on to say:

"Berlin at the same time, cuts the ground from under those doctrinal or fundamentalist liberalisms — the liberalism of
Nozick or Hayek no less than of Rawls or Ackerman — which suppose that the incommensurabilities of moral and political
life, and of liberty itself, can be smoothed away by the application of some theory, or tamed by some talismanic
formula... if there is any liberalism, that is now defensible, it is Berlin's." (1996, p. 67)

Among other things, the above passage is notable for illustrating Gray's decreasing enthusiasm for Hayek.

### Cultural Diversity

In "The politics of cultural diversity," an essay as relevant today as when it was written, Gray argues that The
progressive enthusiasm for what they call "multiculturalism" is "animated by moral hatred of the dominant traditions,
and a voyeuristic fascination with submerged, overwhelmed, or oppositional, cultures." Therefore, it seeks to "entrench
Minority traditions in protected institutions and confer on them arbitrary privileges" (1996, p. 266).

## False Dawn


## Straw Dogs

*Straw Dogs* is one of Gray's best selling books. In it, the "gloomy Gray" comes to the forefront. A lot of this gloom
turns on Gray's interpretation of Darwinism and his reading of its implications, but both are questionable.

The book opens with several curious assertions. First, he writes "Darwin teaches that species are only assemblies of
genes, interacting at random with each other and their shifting environments" (2007, p. 3).

But Darwin had no concept of genes at all. Mendel's work on genes was unknown to him, and was not incorporated into the
mainstream of evolutionary theory until well after Darwin's death.
And even if Gray is using "Darwin" as a synecdoche for "modern Darwinian theory," there is still a problem: in modern
evolutionary theory, it is not true that evolution is purely random. As Richard Dawkins put it, "Darwinism
is a theory of random mutation plus *nonrandom* cumulative natural selection" (Dawkins, 1996, p. 75).

Gray next assigns Christianity a unique status among worldreligions in believing that there is a significant difference
between humans and other animals, and holds it thus responsible for Darwin's theory being at all controversial. However,
quite clearly Judaism and Islam, sharing the Old Testament with Christianity, also differentiate humans from other
animals. But then, so did Aristotle, giving humans a unique character as "the rational animal." True, in religions that
include the idea of reincarnation, it is often thought that souls may move between human and non-human lives in
successive reincarnations. But Buddhism, for instance, regards human reincarnations as special in their openness to the
possibility of enlightenment, since humans, possessing reason, have the ability to grasp the dharma
(Ṅag-dbaṅ-bstan-ʼdzin-nor-bu 2020, p. XXX).
Gray specifically cites Hinduism as a religion in which humans are not special, but hinduamerican.org says "Mankind,
because it is believed to be the most spiritually evolved, thus carries a special responsibility..." (Hindu American
Foundation).

He then describes the idea that "salvation is open to all" as "one of Christianity's most dubious promises" (2007, p.
4). We can grant that, *if* humans are just an outcome of random, material forces, that salvation is open to no one, since
there is no such thing. But why then include the proviso "open to all"? In Gray's view, is salvation open to some but
not to others?

Gray then claims, "in the world shown us by Darwin, there is nothing that can be called progress" (2007, p. 4).
But Darwin himself clearly believed in progress, for example: "And as natural selection works solely by and for the good
of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection." (1872, Chapter XV, par. 55)

Perhaps Gray would argue that his claim is an implication of Darwin's theory that Darwin himself missed; but then he
should at least mention that fact. A reader who had not encountered Darwin in the original would naturally conclude that
this was what Darwin himself thought.

He next claims that "Christianity's cardinal error" is that "humans are different from all other animals" (2007, p. 4).

And yet, as we have seen, this same "error" is present in many traditions. In fact, as Chesterton pointed out, a good
empirically grounded alien, arriving on earth, would immediately recognize that humans are different from all other
animals. [cite].

Recognizing this empirical fact does not immediately yield any metaphysical implications. Recognizing that volcanoes are
different from all other mountains would not mean that we have to grant them some superior ontological status. But
nevertheless, it would be a very poor geologist who did not recognize this significant difference.

In fact, the very "error" that Gray is at pains to criticize demonstrates that his contention that this an error is
wrong: no elephant or chimpanzee or dolphin has ever developed a metaphysics in which their species is marked out as
different from all other animals, rendering their misapprehension in need of correction by a dour British
philosopher.

"if the human species is re-engineered it will not be the result of humanity assuming a God like control of its destiny.
It will be another twist in man's fate" (2007, p. 6).

"'Darwin's dice have rolled badly for the Earth,' Wilson points out." (2007, p. 7).

But given it is all meaningless chance events, what is "bad" about even all life on earth being wiped out? There was
never a point to it anyway.

"Epidemiology and microbiology are better guides to our future than any of our hopes or plans" (2007, p. 9).

Note the radical change in tone!


"the human population growth that has taken place over the past few hundred years resembles nothing so much as the
spikes that occur in the numbers of rabbits, house mice and plague rats" (2007, p. 10).

Gray should be read by every techno-optimist.

"Once a technology enters human life – whether it be fire, the wheel, the automobile, radio, television or the Internet
– it changes it in ways we can never fully understand" (2007, p. 14).


"Technical progress leaves only one problem unsolved: the frailty of human nature. Unfortunately that problem is
insoluble" (2007, p. 15).

"Green thinkers understand that humans can never be masters of the Earth. Yet in their Ludfite struggle against
technology they renew the illusion that the world can be made the instrument of human purposes" (2007, p. 15).

"As Margulis and Sagan have written, we are ourselves technological devices, invented by ancient bacterial communities
as means of genetic survival" (2007, p. 16).

It is weird to describe ancient bacterial communities as "inventing" multicellular organisms when previously Gray has
described evolution as just genes randomly interacting with each other. Furthermore, while he holds that it is an
illusion that humans can shape the world to their purposes, apparently bacteria could do so.

"If our lives are to have any meaning, the power of science must be overthrown, and faith re-established" (2007, p. 18).

As someone who seriously studied Hayek, Gray ought to recognize that the problem here is not science, but scientism. And
his familiarity with Oakeshott ought to have alerted him to the fact that positing a conflict between science and
religion is an ignoratio elenchi.

Gray notes that today, "science alone has the power to silence heretics" (2007, p. 19).

Gray calls the idea that science triumphed in the battle of ideas because it is "the embodiment of rational inquiry" a "fairy tale" (2007, p. 21).

He argues (correctly) that "Galileo won out not because he had the best arguments but because he was able to represent
the new astronomy as part of a coming trend in society" (2007, p. 21).






## The Immortalization Commission


In his book *The Immortalization Commission: Science and the Strange Quest to Cheat Death*, Gray 


Gray moves on from expatiating upon the "message" of Darwinism to describe the two historical episodes that are the
core, as well as the far more interesting portion, of this work. He tells these stories with great panache, making for
lively reading. He first takes up the case of the British parapsychologists active in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. This group included many prominent figures, such as the great ethical theorist Henry Sidgwick, the
classical scholar Frederic Meyers, the Irish poet W.B. Yeats, and British foreign secretary and prime minister Arthur
Balfour. They looked to science to replace religion as the guarantor of man's immortality by seeking empirical evidence
of life after death, most often by trying to receive messages from the departed that convincingly could demonstrate
their continued existence. The most fascinating example of this effort involved automatic writing, a practice in which a
person would write down what were supposed to be messages from beyond the grave, purportedly without conscious awareness
of what they were writing. Over a number of years this practice yield "many thousands" of pages of automatic writing,
which were thought to display "cross-correspondences," so that something written down by one medium formed a complete
message only when put together with the messages transcribed by several others. In the end, the experiment was
inclusive, since the interpretation of the supposed messages was not a determinate matter; to some people they were
clear evidence of an afterlife, while for others, including, seemingly, Gray, they are much more indicative of the
shared subconscious mental life of the writers. Members of the group also involved themselves in attempts to create a
new messiah, a spirit child who would lead mankind to new spiritual heights.

The next chapter of *The Immortalization Commission* deals with the important role occultism played in the Soviet Union
before World War II. This is the section from which the book's title is drawn: the Soviet Union actually established a
commission with that name, as well as a Soviet Committee for Psychical Research. The embalming of Lenin's dead body was
performed largely with this goal of achieving immortality through science in mind. The government went so far, in its
efforts to establish an immortality cult centered on Lenin, as to distribute cubes, with the aim of every subject of the
regime having their own little version of Lenin's cubical shrine in their homes.



## The Soul of the Marionette


A spirit of "nihilistic stoicism" suffuses his 2015 book, *The Soul of the
Marionette*. In these pages he undertakes a sort of jazz improvisation on the theme of human freedom, surveying an
omnium-gatherum of earlier writers' and cultures' thoughts on the topic from the point of view of a "freedom-skeptic." 


## The New Leviathans

Gray's most recent book is *The New Leviathans: Thoughts After Liberalism*.

It is as though the reader has been invited to eavesdrop on Gray's inner dialogues as he mulls over a post-liberal world.

In a book the title of which contains the word "Leviathan," we naturally would expect Thomas Hobbes to play an important
role, and indeed he does. Throughout his meditations, Gray brings up Hobbes again and again. In fact, if one were to be
so bold and foolish enough to offer a "central message" of the book, it might be that the circumstances that prompted
Hobbes to write *Leviathan* have again become salient in our time. The liberal world order that prevailed for some years
after the fall of the Soviet Union is collapsing around us.

Gray first addresses Hobbes by noting that: "Hobbes was a liberal – the only one, perhaps, still worth reading." In
defense of the first half of this claim, he presents the four characteristics of liberalism provided in his own book,
Liberalism, to wit, liberalism is:

- individualist
- egalitarian
- universalist
- meliorist

And he goes on to argue that the above key liberal ideas are present in Hobbes in that, for him:

- "Society is made up of individuals..."
- "[each] equal in being exposed to death at each other's hands..."
- "Human nature is universal in its needs..."
- "With the application of reason, government can be improved..."

Thus Hobbes is "the" proto-liberal. However, as Gray explains, "Each of these [liberal] ideas is a half-truth":

Individuals are the basis of society, but "self-preservation is only one of their needs: bare life is not enough."

Human beings "regularly give up peace and security in order to defend a form of life..."

"The most basic human goods may be universal but they are often sacrificed..."

"Society and government can be improved, but what is gained can always be lost... There is no complete or final exit from
the state of nature."

Gray's claim that Hobbes was a liberal may disconcert some who have interpreted him as a totalitarian. But here Gray
makes a crucial, often overlooked, point about Hobbes, "Hobbes's was a state whose powers were unchecked, but its goals
were strictly limited. Beyond securing its subjects against one another and external enemies, it had no remit."
In other words, Hobbes's sovereign existed to keep its citizens from
going to war with each other, and had whatever power it needed to meet that task. But its area of authority did not
include stopping them from smoking, or encouraging them to exercise, or urging them to approve of
transgenderism, or prompting them to read more. (Unless, of course, one of those projects was
necessary to maintain civil peace: For instance, if smokers and non-smokers were engaging in pitched battles in the streets,
Hobbes's sovereign might need to take a stand on the issue of smoking.)



## Conclusion


One of the results of reading (or re-reading) much of Gray's ouvre in writing this paper is amazement at the
scope of material he has digested: he appears to not only have read everything you have, but also everything three or four
of your colleagues have as well. That, combined with the startling amount of work he has published, makes one wonder
about the nihilism that he seemingly adopts in some of his output. After all, if "it" is all meaningless, why has Gray
spent so much time and effort gifting us with such an extensive, insightful, and provocative body of work?

## Notes


*******

Rather than straightforward histories, or philosophical or political arguments, or personal reminiscences, Gray 
has adopted an approach to his more recent non-fiction work similar to the one that
Milan Kundera took to his novels. These books are meditations on a
topic, approaching it through a variety of vantage points: some anecdotes, some historical episodes briefly narrated, a
few interesting (and sometimes horrifying) statistics, a witty or trenchant aperçu here, a brief argument there. It
worked for Kundera's novels, and it also works when essayed by Gray.
