# Introduction

*Cosmos + Taxis* is pleased to be able to host a festschrift for the philosopher, political theorist, and social
commentator John Gray.

## John Gray's Career

*************

[From Wikipedia]

Gray studied at Exeter College, Oxford, reading philosophy, politics and economics (PPE), completing his B.A., Masters of Philosophy. and Doctorate in Philosophy.

He held posts as lecturer in political theory at the University of Essex, fellow and tutor in politics at Jesus
College, Oxford, and lecturer and then professor of politics at the University of Oxford. He has served as a visiting
professor at Harvard University (1985–86) and Stranahan Fellow at the Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green
State University (1990–1994), and has also held visiting professorships at Tulane University's Murphy Institute (1991)
and Yale University (1994). He was Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics and Political Science
until his retirement from academic life in early 2008.

He began his intellectual life on the left but moved right in the late 1970s, becoming a fan of Nobel Prize-winning free-market
economist F.A. Hayek.

Gray's libertarianism was tempered, however, by studying British philosopher Michael Oakeshott's
critique of "rationalism in politics."

A key document of this shift was his 1988 work, *Liberalisms*. It is a collection of essays written over a period of a dozen
years. As Gray describes the essays, "They embody a single project, pursued continuously over the period in which they
were written -- the project of defining liberalism and giving it a foundation." But, for liberalism, the conclusion was not a
happy one: "The enterprise ended in failure" (Gray 1988, p. vii).



During the 1990s, Gray was associated with New Labour -- the center-left [ideology???]
that brought Tony Blair to power in Westminster -- and he became a prominent critic of global capitalism with his 1998 book
*False Dawn*.


Rather than straightforward histories, or philosophical or political arguments, or personal reminiscences, Gray 
has adopted an approach to his more recent non-fiction work similar to the one that
Milan Kundera took to his novels. These books are meditations on a
topic, approaching it through a variety of vantage points: some anecdotes, some historical episodes briefly narrated, a
few interesting (and sometimes horrifying) statistics, a witty or trenchant aperçu here, a brief argument there. It
worked for Kundera's novels, and it also works for Gray's books.


In his book *The Immortalization Commission: Science and the Strange Quest to Cheat Death*, Gray 


Gray moves on from expatiating upon the "message" of Darwinism to describe the two historical episodes that are the
core, as well as the far more interesting portion, of this work. He tells these stories with great panache, making for
lively reading. He first takes up the case of the British parapsychologists active in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. This group included many prominent figures, such as the great ethical theorist Henry Sidgwick, the
classical scholar Frederic Meyers, the Irish poet W.B. Yeats, and British foreign secretary and prime minister Arthur
Balfour. They looked to science to replace religion as the guarantor of man's immortality by seeking empirical evidence
of life after death, most often by trying to receive messages from the departed that convincingly could demonstrate
their continued existence. The most fascinating example of this effort involved automatic writing, a practice in which a
person would write down what were supposed to be messages from beyond the grave, purportedly without conscious awareness
of what they were writing. Over a number of years this practice yield "many thousands" of pages of automatic writing,
which were thought to display "cross-correspondences," so that something written down by one medium formed a complete
message only when put together with the messages transcribed by several others. In the end, the experiment was
inclusive, since the interpretation of the supposed messages was not a determinate matter; to some people they were
clear evidence of an afterlife, while for others, including, seemingly, Gray, they are much more indicative of the
shared subconscious mental life of the writers. Members of the group also involved themselves in attempts to create a
new messiah, a spirit child who would lead mankind to new spiritual heights.

The next chapter of The Immortalization Commission deals with the important role occultism played in the Soviet Union
before World War II. This is the section from which the book's title is drawn: the Soviet Union actually established a
commission with that name, as well as a Soviet Committee for Psychical Research. The embalming of Lenin's dead body was
performed largely with this goal of achieving immortality through science in mind. The government went so far, in its
efforts to establish an immortality cult centered on Lenin, as to distribute cubes, with the aim of every subject of the
regime having their own little version of Lenin's cubical shrine in their homes.




A spirit of "nihilistic stoicism" suffuses his 2015 book, *The Soul of the
Marionette*. In these pages he undertakes a sort of jazz improvisation on the theme of human freedom, surveying an
omnium-gatherum of earlier writers' and cultures' thoughts on the topic from the point of view of a "freedom-skeptic." 


Gray's most recent book is *The New Leviathans: Thoughts After Liberalism*.

It is as though the reader has been invited to eavesdrop on Gray's inner dialogues as he mulls over a post-liberal world.

In a book the title of which contains the word "Leviathan," we naturally would expect Thomas Hobbes to play an important
role, and indeed he does. Throughout his meditations, Gray brings up Hobbes again and again. In fact, if one were to be
so bold and foolish enough to offer a "central message" of the book, it might be that the circumstances that prompted
Hobbes to write *Leviathan* have again become salient in our time. The liberal world order that prevailed for some years
after the fall of the Soviet Union is collapsing around us.

Gray first addresses Hobbes by noting that: "Hobbes was a liberal – the only one, perhaps, still worth reading." In
defense of the first half of this claim, he presents the four characteristics of liberalism provided in his own book,
Liberalism, to wit, liberalism is:

- individualist
- egalitarian
- universalist
- meliorist

And he goes on to argue that the above key liberal ideas are present in Hobbes in that, for him:

- "Society is made up of individuals..."
- "[each] equal in being exposed to death at each other's hands..."
- "Human nature is universal in its needs..."
- "With the application of reason, government can be improved..."

Thus Hobbes is "the" proto-liberal. However, as Gray explains, "Each of these [liberal] ideas is a half-truth":

Individuals are the basis of society, but "self-preservation is only one of their needs: bare life is not enough."

Human beings "regularly give up peace and security in order to defend a form of life..."

"The most basic human goods may be universal but they are often sacrificed..."

"Society and government can be improved, but what is gained can always be lost... There is no complete or final exit from
the state of nature."

Gray's claim that Hobbes was a liberal may disconcert some who have interpreted him as a totalitarian. But here Gray
makes a crucial, often overlooked, point about Hobbes, "Hobbes's was a state whose powers were unchecked, but its goals
were strictly limited. Beyond securing its subjects against one another and external enemies, it had no remit."

Or, as Michael Oakeshott (whom Gray refers to as one of Hobbes's "best interpreters") put it, "Hobbes is not an
absolutist precisely because he is an authoritarian..." In other words, Hobbes's state existed to keep its citizens from
going to war with each other, and had whatever power it needed to meet that task. But its area of authority did not
include stopping them from smoking, or encouraging them to save prudently for retirement, or urging them to approve of
homosexuality, or prompting them to better appreciate high culture.
